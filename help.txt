Ethan's Character Creator v1.0
by Ethan Deatrick
Created 5/9/2022

This program will allow you to create your very own fantasy RPG character to be used in various ways such as tabletop games!
The character will be saved at the end of the program to a .txt file for your future reference.
Most inputs in the program are done with user mouseclicks on a GUI displayed on a graph.

Images included will be used to determine a picture for the final character as well as some pictures to make the GUI.
